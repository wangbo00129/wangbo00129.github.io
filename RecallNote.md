1. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information

(B) Types of Personal Information Collected
Diary Content Information: Text content, images, audio recordings, and videos you input, add, or capture when writing diaries. This information is used to store your diaries locally, allowing you to view, edit, and review them at any time.
Categorization and Tag Information: Categories and tags you set for each diary entry, used to help you organize and filter diaries locally, making it easy to quickly find specific entries.
Device-Related Information: This Application collects basic device information, such as device model and operating system version, to ensure the Application runs and adapts normally on your device. This information will not be used for other purposes.
(C) Information Necessary for Specific Business Functions
When using the diary recording and management functions, diary content information, categorization and tag information are essential. If you do not provide this information, you will not be able to use the core functions of this Application normally. Device-related information is collected to ensure the stable operation of the Application; if not collected, it might affect some functional experiences of the Application, but it will not prevent you from using basic diary recording and management functions.

(D) Information Usage Statement
This Application will not use the collected personal information for other unrelated purposes, nor will it share, transfer, or publicly disclose your personal information to any third party. This is because this Application operates entirely on the user's local device and does not involve internet transmission or sharing. We will not use your personal information to form direct user profiles. All information is solely used to meet your diary recording and management needs on your local device. Simultaneously, your personal information is expected to remain on your local device throughout your use of this Application, and will be deleted when you delete diaries or uninstall the Application.

2. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies
This Application operates entirely locally and does not use Cookies, scripts, web beacons, Flash Cookies, embedded web links, local storage, or other automated data collection tools to collect your personal information. Therefore, there are no related technical mechanisms or data collection behaviors.

3. How We Share, Transfer, and Publicly Disclose Users' Personal Information
This Application operates solely on your local device and will not share, transfer, or publicly disclose your personal information to any third party, including affiliated companies, partners, or other external organizations. Under no circumstances will your personal information be used for the aforementioned purposes without your explicit consent. Only in response to lawful requests from law enforcement agencies, and after due legal procedures, may necessary information be disclosed, but we will, within the limits permitted by law, strive to protect the security and privacy of your personal information.

4. How We Protect Your Information
(A) Security Protection Measures
Data Storage Security: Your personal information is stored in the secure storage area of your local device. We employ local encryption technology to encrypt important data such as diary content and categorization tags during storage, ensuring the security of the data during storage and preventing unauthorized access and theft.
Access Control: The Application sets up strict access control mechanisms. Only with your authorization can your personal information be accessed and used. Without your explicit operation, no person or program can obtain your diary content or other personal information.
Data Backup and Recovery: We support manual backup of diary data on your local device to prevent data loss. In case of data corruption or loss, you can restore it through backup, ensuring the security of your data.

(C) User Security Tips
When using this Application, we recommend that you set a strong password and change it regularly, avoiding simple or easily guessed passwords.

(D) Responsibility for Security Incidents
Should a personal information security incident occur, we will actively cooperate with relevant departments in the investigation and bear corresponding legal responsibilities within the scope stipulated by law. Simultaneously, we will promptly take measures, such as data recovery and strengthening security protection, to minimize the impact on you.

5. Information Storage
Your personal information is stored on the local device you use and will not be uploaded to any cloud servers or other external storage devices. The storage location depends on your device's storage settings and the Application's default storage path. As information is stored locally, there is no cross-border transmission. We recommend that you regularly clean up diary data you no longer need to free up device storage space.

For example, you can open specific diary entries for editing and modification, or delete diaries you no longer need.
Privacy Preferences: The Application does not currently offer complex privacy preference settings, but you can manage your privacy by, for example, not recording sensitive information. In the future, we will consider adding more privacy preference options to meet your diverse needs.
Communication and Marketing Preferences: As this Application does not involve communication or marketing-related functions, there are no relevant preference settings.
Withdrawal of Consent and Account Cancellation: If you decide to no longer use this Application, uninstalling the Application will be deemed as withdrawing your consent to this Application's use of your personal information, and all personal information stored locally by the Application will also be deleted.
